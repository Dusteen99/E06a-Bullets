# E06a-Bullets
main1 allows you to control a narwhal that can shoot bullets. These bullets an hit the penguins,
and if their health falls below 0, they die. You can control where the narwhal moves and when it
shoots.

main2 has the penguins shooting back every so often. Their bullets hurt you as well, except their bullets
do 3x the damage of yours. If a bullet hits you, it is shown with a damage indicator. If your health falls 
below 0, you disappear, but if you shot bullets before you die and they bring your score back above 0, you 
can be resurrected! 

In both games, your score is tracked and points are awarded on hit and on kill.
